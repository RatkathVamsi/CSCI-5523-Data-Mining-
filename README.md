# CSCI-5523-Data-Mining-
This repository contains the two guided projects I completed in the course CSCI 5523- Introduction to Data Mining in Fall 2023 at the University Of Minnesota.

I was able to learn and apply many of the concepts I learned practically through this project. One thing to note however is that this project is not something the students were instructed to do from scratch. The text you see in the jupyter notebooks was a part of the project questions along with some of the contents in the cells which served as initial basis for the analysis and only specific content in the cells was coded by me.

I have learnt to use many libraries in python which were specific to dataset analysis and data visualization in this course. Additionally, I have also been able to apply concepts like Association Rule Mining, Clustering Algorithms like K-means, Density based along with data cleaning techniques. Was also introduced to various ML models which would be implemented.
